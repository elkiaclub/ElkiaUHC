# ElkiaUHC
The  [@elkiaclub](https://github.com/elkiaclub) datapack for spinning up an [UHC](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ultra_Hardcore).
This is just a barebones setup.

Version v1 has been designed for Minecraft 1.14+. It was thrown together within a couple hours by [@APerfectPenguin](https://github.com/APerfectPenguin) after our previous version broke.

***
## How to use this datapack:
1) Drop it in the world/datapacks  folder
2) Load world, if world was already loaded just do a /reload and everything should be fine. If not, do another /reload
3) To generate teams, /function elkiauhc:create_teams
4) To start, /function elkiauhc:start

Optional:
- Change the players "ShrinkTime" or "PVPTime" for the Counter objective, in number of ticks it should reach before shrinking border or pvp enabled message
